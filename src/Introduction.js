            <h3>A nail-biting fantasy adventure, in a world full of dangerous creatures</h3>
            <div className="intro_section">
            <p>
                Long ago, the lands and seas flourished under the rule of mighty kings and queens, their realms stretching far and wide, adorned with riches and splendor. 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                But, the once-honorable quest for propesrity birthed a shadow of greed, betrayal and darkness within the hearts of rulers, evil descended upon the kingdoms and wars waged. Amidst the chaos, great kingdoms crumbled, consumed by their own tyranny and corruption. Banners tattered in the winds, their once-glorious cities lay in ruins, and people scattered like rice grains.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                In the wake of the fallen kingdoms demise, remnants of their once-proud populace roamed the land, seeking refuge. They found themselves drawn to other fractured realms and wandering tribes converged, driven by a common purpose — to reclaim their land, their heritage, and their dignity. United by shared loss and bound by a collective longing for justice, they forged alliances born of necessity. Violence became a language spoken too readily, selfishness a guiding principle, and revenge a driving force, and soon whispers of resistance stirred and banners of defiance flew high.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                As the lands began to tremble beneath the weight of these uprisings, a grim realization dawned — factions were no longer seeking reclaimation of their fallen kingdoms...they sought revenge and made foe of anything that stood in their way.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                It is up to the 4 remaining kingdoms of the North and West to come together to eradicate the threat for good.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Queen Ahris, ruler of The Great Enen Sea, from the North, has summoned the greatest Knight of the Kingdom to journey through deep forests, deadly mountains and monster infested caves, to defeat the mighty Troll of Tarragon.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <br/>
                
                But beware! - You will be entering rival territories...
